# Frequently Asked Questions

## Who started Code Bridge?

Codebridge was originally started by the non-profit OpenUp (known at that time as Code for South Africa).

## Why was Codebridge started?

Codebridge was initially started to promote the use of technology in service of others and for the greater South African social good. At first this took the form of advocating for civic technology and open data amongst professionals working in technical fields, however over time Codebridge extended its scope to also include engaging with South African youth and promoting informed public participation through technology.

To date Codebridge has active communities in Cape Town, Durban, Bredasdorp and Vredendal. Codebridge is expected to further expand its impact in 2019 as more youth groups in secondary cities join the network of technology-driven active citizens.

## What projects does Codebridge currently have live?

Codebridge is a registered as an organisation on Github. The Github organisation [houses a range of projects that actively maintained by community members themselves](https://github.com/codebridge-za), the most notable being the [Seeking Shelter](https://codebridge-za.github.io/seeking-shelter/), [Living Wage](https://living-wage.co.za/) and [Medicine Price Registry](https://mpr.code4sa.org/) projects.

In addition, several projects that started in the Codebridge community has spun off into their own full scale projects, for example the [Buza](https://github.com/buza-project) and [Public People](https://github.com/public-people) projects.

## Who runs Codebridge?
In line with the open-source movement, Codebridge Newlands is a completely open and volunteer driven community. From its inception Codebridge was intended to be a network of grassroot/decentralised civic-tech communities that broadly adhere to the [Codebridge Manifesto](manifesto.md). 

However, maintaining open and/or volunteer driven communities over a sustained period of time can be quite stressful (as most open source project maintainers can attest). In order to sustain and grow the network, Codebridge encourage community members who feel compelled to play a larger part in keeping Codebridge operation to take on the role of a community steward.

Each local Codebridge chapter is run by a couple of these community stewards working in tandem to keep their chapter operational and represent their specific community to the in the broader Codebridge network.
